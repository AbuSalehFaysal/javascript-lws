// JS Common mistakes

// assignment operator =
// conditional double equal operator ==

// sometimes adding two floating numbers, we do not get the expected answers, because js takes 64 bit floating number
// to avoid this problem we need to convert the floats to decimals by multiplying it using 10 and then divide it by 10
