// const keyword

// const variable cannot be reassigned.

// const variable value should be assigned while declaring the variable.

// always use const when you declare an array, object, function, regular expression.

// const works in the block scope just like let.

// const variables can be hoisted as well but it does not initial a default value unlike var variables.
