// JS array constant
// from ES6, it is introduced that array should be declared using const instead of var or let.

const arr = ["Abu", "Saleh", "Faysal"];

// array is a kind of a box, the box cannot be change but we can change the value of the box. That is why we should use const while declaring array or objects.

// hoisting is not possible in const unlike var.

// const works for block scope

// redeclare an array using const is not allowed
