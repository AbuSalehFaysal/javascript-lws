// JS Strict Mode

"use strict";

// It is not a statement but a literal expression comes from ES5

// You can use strict mode in all your programs, it helps you to write cleaner code. For example you cannot assign a value to a variable without declaring it.

// strict mode converts bad syntax into errors

// reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names in strict mode
