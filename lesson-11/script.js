// JS Data Types

// js has dynamic types - can store different types of data in a single variable

// 1. String Data Types (Single quote inside double quote, double quote inside single quote) --- "Abu Saleh Faysal", "Abeer"

// 2. Number data Types --- 10,1

// 3. Boolean data types --- true, false

// 4. Array Data Types --- [0,5,10,15,20]

// 5. Object data Types --- {name: "Faysal", age: 25}

// 6. Undefined data types (Empty and undefined are not the same) --- let name; declared but not defined.

// While working with string and number, string will get more priority.

// js evaluates any expression from left to right.

// using typeOf operator, we can find out the data type of any variable.
